"""`forge --update` — re-apply options to an existing forge-generated project.

Reads the ``[forge.options]`` stamp from ``forge.toml``, runs the current
resolver against it, re-applies every fragment to each discovered
backend, then re-stamps ``forge.toml`` with the current forge version
and the fully-defaulted option map. Injections are idempotent (B2.3
sentinels), so running this repeatedly is a no-op when nothing changed
and a clean in-place update when a fragment snippet was modified or a
new Option was added.

Provenance classification (1.0.0a1+):
  Before re-applying, ``classify_project_state`` compares each recorded
  file's SHA to the on-disk content and returns a per-path state:
    * ``unchanged`` — safe to re-emit
    * ``user-modified`` — preserve; skip fragment files, warn on injection targets
    * ``missing`` — user deleted; re-emit

The classification is exposed in the summary dict and used to guide
``skip_existing_files`` decisions. Full three-way merge lands in Phase 2.2.

Out of scope (still):
  - Template-level Copier updates (base template changes). Users who want
    those can ``cd <backend>/`` and run ``copier update`` directly —
    ``.copier-answers.yml`` is the input.
  - Deleting files from Options that were turned off. Needs the provenance
    manifest follow-up — partial in this alpha; full in 1.0.0a3.
