"""Per-module coverage gate (Epic S, 1.1.0-alpha.1).

Two layers of coverage gating, by design:

1. **Project-wide floor** lives in ``pyproject.toml`` as ``fail_under``.
   Coarse safety net across every module.
2. **Critical-path per-module floors** live here, in ``MODULE_FLOORS``. The
   modules in this table are the ones where a silent coverage regression
   would ship to every generated project on the next ``forge --update``.

Every CI run produces ``coverage.json`` via ``pytest --cov-report=json``. This
test parses that report and fails when any listed module drops below its
floor. When ``coverage.json`` isn't present (e.g. a developer ran a focused
subset locally), the test is skipped with a helpful hint.

See ``docs/coverage-policy.md`` for the ratchet policy — floors move
upward each sprint; lowering any of them requires a CHANGELOG note +
RFC-002 justification.

# feature_injector dropped after the new merge-mode code paths landed,
# then recovered after the test backfill. New measured baseline:
