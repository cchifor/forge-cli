"""Package integrity gate (Epic DD, 1.1.0-alpha.1).

Catches the two classes of regression that bite users in the field but
pass every other test:

1. **Missing template files in the shipped artefact.** Golden snapshots
   verify forge's generation output, but if ``uv build`` itself drops
   a file from the sdist/wheel, forge installs cleanly then fails at
   ``forge new`` with a cryptic copier "template not found" error. We
   smoke-check a handful of stable sentinel paths in both archives.
2. **Cache + build clutter leaking into the packaged artefact.**
   ``.ruff_cache/``, ``.pytest_cache/``, ``node_modules/``,
   ``.dart_tool/`` and similar can materialise in ``forge/templates/``
   during local dev and ship to PyPI unless MANIFEST.in excludes them.
   This test asserts none of those contaminants appear in either
   archive.

Gated behind ``@pytest.mark.package_integrity`` so the main pytest run
doesn't pay the ~6s ``uv build`` cost. CI runs it on ubuntu × 3.13 via
the ``package-integrity`` job. Developers can run it locally with
``pytest -m package_integrity``.
